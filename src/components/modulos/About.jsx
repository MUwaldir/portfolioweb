        <p className="parrafo">
        I am a systems engineer specialized in front-end and back-end web development, working with programming languages such as JavaScript, Python and PHP. In addition, I have experience using version control technologies such as GitHub and Git to manage repositories. In design, I use tools like Figma and Adobe XD to create attractive and functional interfaces. In terms of databases, I work with MySQL and PostgreSQL, and I use frameworks like Django and React to develop robust and scalable applications. My studies in different institutions such as Universidad Nacional Del Centro Del Per√∫, Platzi, Henry, Universidad Continental and CETAM PUCP have allowed me to acquire a set of skills and knowledge that allow me to successfully tackle any web development project.
